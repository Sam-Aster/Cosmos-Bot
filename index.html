    <h2>A Community Interaction Manager.</h2>
    <h3>What is Cosmos?</h3>
    <p>
        Cosmos is a community manager that works with Twitch and Discord. It reduces the amount of time, effort, and
        stress that goes into managing a community, as well as offering a reward system to encourage interaction and
        collaboration. Cosmos accomplishes this by handling the moderation and organization of a community, as well as
        providing a way for community leaders to reward their members for their loyalty and support.

                <strong>Discord Server Management via Custom Client =&gt;</strong> Cosmos is a Discord server manager
                which
                automates the process of server creation for Discord users by automatically enabling key features that
                one
                would hope to find in a safe and inclusive Discord server:
                <ul>
                    <li>privacy-enabled by default. When you are invited to a server, you tend to immediately see who's
                        in that community. That's excellent when you want to see if you recognize someone you know, but
                        raiders will attack publicly accessible servers and their members, and a malicious party could
                        destroy the community you cherish. Cosmos combats this bycreating two servers - a verification
                        server that deters raiders and other malicious parties, and your community server.</li>
                    <li>an explicit content filter and auto-moderation tools, designed by Discord's very own API and
                        Discord.js, one of the most popular libraries for building a Discord Client application.</li>
                    <li>role and channel creator and permission manager.</li>
                    <li>server expectations and responsibilities management tools such as rules creation and onboarding
                        supervision.</li>
                    <li>and more soon to come!</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Discord Bot Presence =&gt;</strong> Ensure your members always have a friend in need. Cosmos is
                more
                than just a server manager, as they have a bot presence that is designed with end-users in mind.
                <ul>
                    <li>Cosmos will always be available, monitoring messages and ensuring that members are given an
                        understanding and welcoming environment, allowing users to express themselves individually and
                        feely
                        without fear of discrimination, harrassment, or retaliation.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Twitch Chatbot =&gt;</strong> Give yourself a helping hand with a partner that can keep your
                friends, fans, and followers coming back for more with features like:
                <ul>
                    <li>active chatter recognition. Reward your members with ranks that can grant them special perks,
                        both
                        on- and off-stream.</li>
                    <li>commands that keep your viewers entertained in-chat with games, quotes, and celebratory
                        messages, as
                        well as stream and channel information or social links.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
