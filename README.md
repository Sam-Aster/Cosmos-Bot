# Cosmos
## A Community Interaction Manager.
### What is Cosmos?
 1) **Discord Server Management via Custom Client =>** Cosmos is a Discord server manager which automates the process of server creation for Discord users by automatically enabling key features that one would hope to find in a safe and inclusive Discord server:
 - an explicit content filter and auto-moderation tools,  designed by Discord's very own API and Discord.js, one of the most popular libraries for building a Discord Client application.
 - privacy-enabled by default. When you are invited to a server, you tend to immediately see who's in that community. That's excellent when you want to see if you recognize someone you know, but raiders will hit publicly accessible servers and destroy the community you cherish. Cosmos creates two servers - a verification server that deters raiders and other malicious parties.
- role and channel creator and permission manager.
- server expectations and responsibilities management tools such as rules creation and onboarding supervision.
- and more soon to come!
2) **Discord Bot Presence =>** Ensure your members always have a friend in need. Cosmos is more than just a server manager, as they have a bot presence that is designed with end-users in mind.
 - Cosmos will always be available, monitoring messages and ensuring that members are given an understanding and welcoming environment, allowing users to express themselves individually and feely without fear of discrimination, harrassment, or retaliation.
3) **Twitch Chatbot =>** Give yourself a helping hand with a partner that can keep your friends, fans, and followers coming back for more with features like:
 -  active chatter recognition. Reward your members with ranks that can grant them special perks, both on- and off-stream.
 -  commands that keep your viewers entertained in-chat with games, quotes, and celebratory messages, as well as stream and channel information or social links.
